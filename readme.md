## 🎮 Final Project: Let's Play Tennis!

This is my final project for Code in Place — a simple yet dynamic tennis game using Python's `graphics` library.

### 🏓 How to Play
- Use your mouse to move the paddle.
- Hit the bouncing tennis ball.
- Earn points for each successful hit.
- The ball gets faster as your score increases.
- The game ends when the ball touches the bottom wall.
