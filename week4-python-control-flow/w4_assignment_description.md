High-Low Game

We want you to gain more experience working with control flow and Booleans in Python. To do this, we are going to have you develop a game! The game is called High-Low and the way it's played goes as follows:

Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent. You get to see your number, but not the computer's!

You make a guess, saying your number is either higher than or lower than the computer's number

If your guess matches the truth (ex. you guess your number is higher, and then your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!

These steps make up one round of the game. The game is over after all rounds have been played.

Here's a sample run of the game where we play three rounds (user input is in blue for visual clarity):


Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
Round 1
Your number is 8
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 35
Your score is now 1

Round 2
Your number is 88
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 100
Your score is now 1

Round 3
Your number is 63
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
You were right! The computer's number was 5
Your score is now 2

Thanks for playing!
